# Bare Conductive Simple Touch Board Bluettooth sketch

Simple sketch that sends data from the [Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/) wirelessly via Bluetooth. The data can be printed on a screen to see when an electrode of the board was touched and released or used in other programs, for example Processing.

## Requirements

* You should make sure that you have followed our [Setting up Arduino with your Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-arduino-with-your-touch-board/) tutorial before using this (or any other) of our code examples
 

## Install

1. Close the Arduino IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/simple_touch_bluetooth/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **Proximity_MP3** folder and move it to **Arduino Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Arduino
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Arduino	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Arduino
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Arduino


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Arduino IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
